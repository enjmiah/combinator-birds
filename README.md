Combinator Birds
===
This will be a javascript-based implementation of the graphical notation for [combinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic) described in [this paper - To Dissect a Mockingbird](http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/) by David Keenan.
It is currently a **work in progress.**

The goal of this project is to make a cross-browser, simple implementation that works directly in the browser without having to download anything. This will be accomplished using Github Pages for hosting.
Graphical notation of lambda calculus is more accessible than regular mathematical notation.

## Combinators

Several of the combinators described at [Combinator Birds](http://www.angelfire.com/tx4/cus/combinator/birds.html) will be implemented.
~~(Hopefully,)~~ a modified Why Bird will be provided that works with eager evaluation.

## Technology

HTML, CSS, SVG, Javascript
planned: HTML5 Drag and Drop

## Similar projects

There are several other graphical notations out there, in addition to other implementations of this one.
